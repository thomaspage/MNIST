# Modified MNIST

The goal of this project is to classify images based on the mathematical equations present within them. The algorithms used to perform this image analysis task were logistic regression (LR), a feed forward neural network (NN), and a convolutional neural network (CNN).

The classifiers can be found in the Classifiers folder.
Supplementary training data such as the EMNIST dataset can be found in the Data folder.
